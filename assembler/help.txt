NAME
        leek-asm - The Little Educational Electronic Komputer Assembler

SYNOPSIS
        leek-asm [options]

DESCRIPTION
        leek-asm is an assembler for the LEEK16 architecture. It can read
        assembly source code and output a binary file that can be read by a
        LEEK16 computer. Normaly you would run the output file using the
        leek-vm virtual machine.

        This program is typically used to assemble a LEEK16 program using the
        command

            leek-asm inputfile -o outputfile

        You can more generally run the assembler with

            leek-asm [options]

OPTIONS
        {filename}
                        If no flag is used, the option is interpreted as the
                        input filename to be read.

        -h
                        Prints this help message then exits.

        -o {filename}
                        Declares the output filename.
