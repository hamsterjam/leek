 * Operation.hpp

 * This is just a fancy enum that lets me store some extra information
 * alongside the keys. In this case we store an opcode and an operation type.
 * Note that the default constructor and asignment operator are deleted meaning
 * that the only valid Operation variables are the ones defined inside the
 * class itself
