I thought it would be fun to make a toy 16-bit virtual machine in the style of Notchs 0x10^c, but without the game part.
This could eventually involve building an assembler, a compiler, an operating system, and maybe even some useful software.

I tried to keep the instruction set *fairly* simple so that it should be possible to implement it in hardware if I ever want to go down that route.

For now there is not much to talk about because there is not much here... Once the VM is mostly up and running I'll update this read me.
