This is a project to design and implement a toy 16-but computation system from the hardware up.
The aim is to implement a full computation platform (first as a virtual machine, maybe actual hardware eventually)
and build up software for it to the point where I have a working system.

The project is split into modules each doing a specific task related to building a computation platform

### Virtual Machine

The virtual machine is a program that emulates the (theoretical) hardware of a LEEK computer.
It runs LEEK byte code generated by one of the other tools.
Although it has fairly limitied capabilities at the moment, it can be upgraded with additional peripheral i/o devices to make it actually useful.
As of now, it is only really useful for very simple test programs to verify that the instruction set is expressive and that the operations are being performed correctly.

### Hex2Bin

A very simple program that reads 2 characters at a time, interperets it as an 8-bit hexadecimal number and writes it to the output.
In lieu of an actuall assembler or a compiler, you can use this to produce byte code to run on the virtual machine by hand.
