NAME
        leek-vm - The Little Educational Electronic Komputer Virtual Machine

SYNOPSIS
        leek-vm [options] [file]

DESCRIPTION
        leek-vm is a virtual machine that emulates the LEEK16 architecture. It
        reads data from file, loads the given program into memory and runs it.

        This program is typically used to run a LEEK16 program with the command

            leek-vm file

        You can more generally start the virtual machine with

            leek-vm [options]

OPTIONS

        {filename}
                        If no flag is used, the option is interpreted as the
                        filename to load

        -d {name} {position} {line}
                        Adds a device 'name' to the virtual machine and maps it
                        to memory 'position' written in hexadecimal. The device
                        will interrupt on 'line'.

        -h
                        Print this help message.

        -i
                        Enable interactive mode.

        -s              Enable a standard set up for devices. This includes for
                        now:
                                numdisp     c100    0

        -x
                        Changes input to hexadecimal mode. This will read 4
                        characters ignoring whitespace and interperet it as a
                        16 bit instruction written in hexadecimal.
