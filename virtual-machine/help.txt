NAME
        leek-vm - The Little Educational Electronic Komputer Virtual Machine

SYNOPSIS
        leek-vm [options] [file]

DESCRIPTION
        leek-vm is a virtual machine that emulates the LEEK16 architecture. It
        reads data from file, loads the given program into memory and runs it.

        This program is typically used to run a LEEK16 program with the command

            leek-vm file

        You can more generally start the virtual machine with

            leek-vm [options] [file]

OPTIONS
        The options may be given in any order, but the file name must be the
        final argument.

        -h
                        Print this help message.

        -i
                        Enable interactive mode.

        -m {mode}
                        Sets the input mode. mode is either hex or bin with the
                        default being bin. In bin mode, the virtual machine
                        will read 2 chars and interpret it as a 16 bit
                        instruction. In hex mode the virtual machine will read
                        4 chars and interpret it as a 16 bit number written in
                        hexadecimal.
