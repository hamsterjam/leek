LEEK16 Architecture
===================

This is a cute little RISC machine designed to have an easy (I hope) instruction set to implement in hardware. The opcodes for everything are essentially temporary untill I figure out more specifics of the hardware. For now, I think this is a pretty good representation of the capabilities of the final architecture.

Instruction format
------------------

Instructions are one of the following 5 types. During the operation. The result of any operation will either be written to the register destination, or the address in memory stored in destination depending on the operation. If the destination register is 0, then the output is discarded

Registers
---------

There are 16 registers. All are 16 bits in length. There are 6 special purpose registers. All may be written to (potentially breaking things) with the exception of MBZ.

```
0  = 0x0 = MBZ
11 = 0xb = AUX
12 = 0xc = IHP
13 = 0xd = FLAGS
14 = 0xe = STACK
15 = 0xf = PC
```
The MBZ register is the **M**ust **B**e **Z**ero register. It will always hold the value 0, any attempts to write to it will be ignored.
The AUX register is an auxiliary arithmitec register. Currently, it only has one use, to store the upper word of the result of a MUL instruction.
The IHP register is the **I**nterrupt **H**andler **P**ointer. It points to a subroutine in memory that is called when an interrupt occurs.
The STACK register is used for PUSH and POP operations. It points to the most recently PUSHed value.
The PC register is the program counter. This points to the next operation to be executed by the processor.
The bits in the FLAGS register correspond to flags set by operations. Any flag without a designation should be treated as reserved. Currently designated flags are shown in the following table.

<table style="width:100%; table-layout: fixed">
    <tr align="center">
        <th> 0 <th> 1 <th> 2 <th> 3 <th> 4 <th> 5 <th> 6 <th> 7
    <tr align="center">
        <td> ZERO
        <td> NEG
        <td> CARRY
        <td> OVER
        <td> ICF
        <td>
        <td>
        <td> ISFs
    <tr align="center">
        <th> 8 <th> 9 <th> 10 <th> 11 <th> 12 <th> 13 <th> 14 <th> 15
    <tr align="center">
        <td> ISF0
        <td> ISF1
        <td> ISF2
        <td> ISF3
        <td> ISF4
        <td> ISF5
        <td> ISF6
        <td> ISF7
</table>

The ZERO flag is set if the result of an arithmetic or logic operation is 0. Similarly, the NEG flag is set if the result of an arithmetic or logic opreation is negative when it is interpreted in twos-complement. The CARRY flag is set set if there is an unsigned overflow of an addition opperation, or an unsigned underflow of a subtraction operation (a borrow). The OVER flag is set if there is a signed overflow from addition or subtraction.
The ICF is the **I**nterrupt **C**ontrol **F**lag. It's state affects how interrupts are handled. Flags 7 ~ 15 are **I**nterrupt **S**ignal **F**lags. They are set if the system recieves an interrupt signal along the corresponding interrupt line (ISFs is for software interrupts).

Interrupts
----------

This architecture as support for up to 8 hardware interrupt lines. When an interrupt signal is recieved, one of the Interrupt Signal Flags is set. If in addition the Interrupt Control Flag is set, normal operation is interrupted and the interrupt handler is called. Concretely, the value of PC is pushed to the stack as if PUSH were called and the PC register is set to the value of the IHP register. Additionally the Interrupt Control Flag is cleared. Because this architecture does not feature privileged execution contexts, Interrupt Signal Flags and the Interrupt Control Flag can be set and cleared from any userspace code. Although it is *possible* it is really not a good idea to modify these flags under normal operation.
